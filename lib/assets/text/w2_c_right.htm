<b>Box 12.</b> The following list explains the codes shown in box 12. You may<font size="9"> </font>
need this information to complete your tax return. Elective deferrals
(codes D, E, F, and S) and designated Roth contributions (codes AA,
BB, and EE) under all plans are generally limited to a total of $20,500
($14,000 if you only have SIMPLE plans; $23,500 for section 403(b)
plans if you qualify for the 15-year rule explained in Pub. 571). Deferrals
under code G are limited to $20,500. Deferrals under code H are limited
to $7,000.
   However, if you were at least age 50 in 2022, your employer may have<font size="9"> </font>
allowed an additional deferral of up to $6,500 ($3,000 for section
401(k)(11) and 408(p) SIMPLE plans). This additional deferral amount is
not subject to the overall limit on elective deferrals. For code G, the limit
on elective deferrals may be higher for the last 3 years before you reach
retirement age. Contact your plan administrator for more information.
Amounts in excess of the overall elective deferral limit must be included
in income. See the Form 1040 instructions.

a make-up pension contribution for a prior year(s) when you were in
military service. To figure whether you made excess deferrals, consider
these amounts for the year shown, not the current year. If no year is
shown, the contributions are for the current year.
