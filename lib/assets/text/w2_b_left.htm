<b>Earned income credit (EIC).</b> You may be able to take the EIC<font size="12"> </font>
for 2022 if your adjusted gross income (AGI) is less than a
certain amount. The amount of the credit is based on income
and family size. Workers without children could qualify for a
smaller credit. You and any qualifying children must have valid
social security numbers (SSNs). You can't take the EIC if your
investment income is more than the specified amount for 2022
or if income is earned for services provided while you were an
inmate at a penal institution. For 2022 income limits and more
information, visit <i>www.irs.gov/EITC</i>. See also Pub. 596, Earned
Income Credit. <b>Any EIC that is more than your tax liability is
refunded to you, but only if you file a tax return.</b>
