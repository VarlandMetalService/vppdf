<b>Corrections.</b> If your name, SSN, or address is incorrect, correct
Copies B, C, and 2 and ask your employer to correct your
employment record. Be sure to ask the employer to file Form
W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the Social
Security Administration (SSA) to correct any name, SSN, or money
amount error reported to the SSA on Form W-2. Be sure to get
your copies of Form W-2c from your employer for all corrections
made so you may file them with your tax return. If your name and
SSN are correct but aren't the same as shown on your social
security card, you should ask for a new card that displays your
correct name at any SSA office or by calling 800-772-1213. You
may also visit the SSA website at <i>www.SSA.gov</i>.
