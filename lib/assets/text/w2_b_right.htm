<b>Corrections.</b> If your name, SSN, or address is incorrect, correct
Copies B, C, and 2 and ask your employer to correct your
employment record. Be sure to ask the employer to file Form
W-2c, Corrected Wage and Tax Statement, with the SSA to
correct any name, SSN, or money amount error reported to the
SSA on Form W-2. Be sure to get your copies of Form W-2c
from your employer for all corrections made so you may file
them with your tax return. If your name and SSN are correct but
aren't the same as shown on your social security card, you
should ask for a new card that displays your correct name at
any SSA office or by calling 800-772-1213. You may also visit
the SSA website at <i>www.SSA.gov</i>.
